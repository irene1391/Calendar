# Funtion

#### Basic
Users are able to login/logout/register, add and remove events dynamically. Support a month-by-month view of the calendar.
Show one month at a time, with buttons to move forward or backward. No limit to how far forward or backward the user can go. Users can register and log in to the website. All events have a date and time but do not need to have a duration. AJAX does not ask the server for events from a certain username. Instead, AJAX asks the server for events, and the server responds with the events for only the currently logged-in user (from the session). All user and event data be kept in a database.
At no time the main page needs to be reloaded. User registration, user authentication, event addition, and event deletion all be handled by JavaScript and AJAX requests to the server.

#### Google map
Users are able to add the address of the event in our calendar. This function helps the user know the exact location. When the user clicks on the map, the map will show a marker and location information. Users can save the location information into his eventsï¼Œand then the event will display this location information to remind the user where the event happens.

#### Tag
This function helps users to differentiate the priority of events by different colors. When a user creates an event, he can select a color from the tag selection box. After that, the background color of this event will change to the color the user set before.

#### Toggle Agenda 
This function helps users to view their whole events in the month selected. When a user clicks the Toggle Agenda the whole events will be displayed under the calendar from in order date. This function is used to create a monthly to-do list. Users are able to check their agenda, being easier to plan their own schedule.

#### Repeat Event
This function helps users to set their event display at a certain time. When the user creates an event, he can choose whether this event is repeated by selecting the repeat day and repeat frequency. This can be used, for example, weekly company meetings, go to the client every three days this month.

#### Closure Component
Imitating the component structure of ReactJS to create a unique closure environment to handle feature logic and render components, increasing code reusability.
